## Welcome to OnjoujiToki's Profile Page

Hello, I am OnjoujiToki. Currently studying in UCD as a junior computer science student.
I speak mandarin (native), English and Japanese. I am cute because I am using cute anime girl profile image.
I have experience on C++(mainly), Python, C and currently learning Haskell and Go.
I play Dota2 as a 6000MMR core player, and also played for our university team, UC Davis Aggies.
I will work in Toyko someday, and it is definitely my favorite city among the world.
